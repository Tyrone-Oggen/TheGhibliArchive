            Studio Ghibli, Inc. (Japanese: 株式会社スタジオジブリ Hepburn:
            Kabushiki gaisha Sutajio Jiburi) is a Japanese animation film studio
            based in Koganei, Tokyo, Japan. The studio is best known for its
            anime feature films, and has also produced several short films,
            television commercials, and one television film. It was founded on
            15 June 1985, after the success of Nausicaä of the Valley of the
            Wind (1984), with funding by Tokuma Shoten. Studio Ghibli has also
            collaborated with video game studios on the visual development of
            several video games.

            Six of Studio Ghibli's films are among the 10 highest-grossing anime
            films made in Japan, with Spirited Away (2001) being the second
            highest, grossing over US$290 million worldwide. Many of their works
            have won the Animage Anime Grand Prix award, and four have won the
            Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year. Five of Studio
            Ghibli's films have received Academy Award nominations. Spirited
            Away won the Golden Bear in 2002 and the Academy Award for Best
            Animated Feature Film in 2003. Totoro, a character from My Neighbor
            Totoro, is the studio's mascot.

            On 3 August 2014, Studio Ghibli temporarily halted production
            following the retirement of director Hayao Miyazaki, who co-founded
            the studio with the late Isao Takahata. In February 2017, Toshio
            Suzuki announced that Miyazaki had come out of retirement again to
            direct a new feature film, How Do You Live?, with Studio Ghibli.
          </p>
          <p className="body-content">
            The name Ghibli was given by Hayao Miyazaki from the Italian noun
            ghibli, based on the Libyan-Arabic name for the hot desert wind of
            that country, the idea being the studio would "blow a new wind
            through the anime industry".] It also refers to an Italian aircraft,
            the Caproni Ca.309 Ghibli. Although the Italian word is more
            accurately transliterated as ギブリ (Giburi), the Japanese name of
            the studio is ジブリ (Jiburi).

            Founded on June 15, 1985, the studio is headed by the directors
            Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata and the producer Toshio Suzuki.
            Prior to the formation of the studio, Miyazaki and Takahata had
            already had long careers in Japanese film and television animation
            and had worked together on Hols: Prince of the Sun and Panda! Go,
            Panda!; and Suzuki was an editor at Tokuma Shoten's Animage manga
            magazine. The studio was founded after the success of the 1984 film
            Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, written and directed by Miyazaki
            for Topcraft and distributed by Toei Company. The origins of the
            film lie in the first two volumes of a serialized manga written by
            Miyazaki for publication in Animage as a way of generating interest
            in an anime version. Suzuki was part of the production team on the
            film and founded Studio Ghibli with Miyazaki, who also invited
            Takahata to join the new studio. The studio has mainly produced
            films by Miyazaki, with the second most prolific director being
            Takahata (most notably with Grave of the Fireflies). Other directors
            who have worked with Studio Ghibli include Yoshifumi Kondo, Hiroyuki
            Morita, Gorō Miyazaki, and Hiromasa Yonebayashi. Composer Joe
            Hisaishi has provided the soundtracks for most of Miyazaki's Studio
            Ghibli films. In their book Anime Classics Zettai!, Brian Camp and
            Julie Davis made note of Michiyo Yasuda as "a mainstay of Studio
            Ghibli’s extraordinary design and production team". At one time the
            studio was based in Kichijōji, Musashino, Tokyo.

            In August 1996, Disney and Tokuma Shoten formed a partnership in
            which Buena Vista Pictures would be the sole international
            distributor for Tokuma Shoten's Studio Ghibli animated films. Since
            then, all three afore-mentioned films by Miyazaki at Studio Ghibli
            that were previously dubbed by Streamline Pictures have been
            re-dubbed by Disney. On June 1, 1997, Tokuma Shoten Publishing
            consolidated its media operations by merging Studio Ghibli, Tokuma
            Shoten Intermedia software and Tokuma International under one
            location. Many of Ghibli's films in Japan are theatrically
            distributed by Toho while home video releases are handled by Walt
            Disney Studios Home Entertainment Japan. Wild Bunch holds the
            international sales rights to many of Ghibli's films. Ghibli's main
            international distribution partners also include Disney (Japan Home
            Video, Taiwan, France), GKIDS (North America), StudioCanal (United
            Kingdom and Ireland), and Madman Entertainment (Australia).
            Germany-based Wild Bunch itself handles international sales for
            Studio Ghibli's works. Over the years, there has been a close
            relationship between Studio Ghibli and the magazine Animage, which
            regularly runs exclusive articles on the studio and its members in a
            section titled "Ghibli Notes." Artwork from Ghibli's films and other
            works are frequently featured on the cover of the magazine. Saeko
            Himuro's novel Umi ga Kikoeru was serialised in the magazine and
            subsequently adapted into Ocean Waves (film), Studio Ghibli's only
            animated feature length film created for television and it was
            directed by Tomomi Mochizuki. In October 2001, the Ghibli Museum
            opened in Mitaka, Tokyo. It contains exhibits based on Studio Ghibli
            films and shows animations, including a number of short Studio
            Ghibli films not available elsewhere.

            The studio is also known for its strict "no-edits" policy in
            licensing their films abroad due to Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind
            being heavily edited for the film's release in the United States as
            Warriors of the Wind. The "no cuts" policy was highlighted when
            Miramax co-chairman Harvey Weinstein suggested editing Princess
            Mononoke to make it more marketable. A Studio Ghibli producer is
            rumoured to have sent an authentic Japanese sword with a simple
            message: "No cuts". Between 1999 and 2005, Studio Ghibli was a
            subsidiary brand of Tokuma Shoten, however, that partnership ended
            on April 2005 when Studio Ghibli was spun off from Tokuma Shoten,
            and was re-established as an independent company with relocated
            headquarters. On February 1, 2008, Toshio Suzuki stepped down from
            the position of Studio Ghibli president, which he had held since
            2005, and Koji Hoshino (former president of Walt Disney Japan) took
            over. Suzuki said he wanted to improve films with his own hands as a
            producer, rather than demanding this from his employees. Suzuki
            decided to hand over the presidency to Hoshino because Hoshino has
            helped Studio Ghibli to sell its videos since 1996 and has also
            aided the release of the Princess Mononoke film in the United
            States. Suzuki still serves on the company's board of directors. Two
            Studio Ghibli short films created for the Ghibli Museum were shown
            at the Carnegie Hall Citywise Japan NYC Festival: "House Hunting"
            and "Mon Mon the Water Spider" were screened on March 26, 2011.

            Takahata developed a project for release after Gorō Miyazaki's
            (director of Tales from Earthsea and Hayao's son) The Tale of the
            Princess Kaguya – an adaptation of The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter.
            The last film Hayao Miyazaki directed before retiring from feature
            films was The Wind Rises which is about the Mitsubishi A6M Zero and
            its founder. On Sunday, September 1, 2013, Hayao Miyazaki held a
            press conference in Venice to confirm his retirement, saying: "I
            know I've said I would retire many times in the past. Many of you
            must think, 'Once again.' But this time I am quite serious." On
            January 31, 2014, it was announced that Gorō Miyazaki will direct
            his first anime television series, Sanzoku no Musume Rōnya, an
            adaptation of Astrid Lindgren's Ronia the Robber's Daughter for NHK.
            The series is computer-animated, produced by Polygon Pictures, and
            co-produced by Studio Ghibli. In March 2014, Toshio Suzuki retired
            as producer and assumed the new position of general manager.
            Yoshiaki Nishimura replaced Suzuki in the producer role. On August
            3, 2014, Toshio Suzuki announced that Studio Ghibli would take a
            "brief pause" to re-evaluate and restructure in the wake of
            Miyazaki's retirement. He stated some concerns about where the
            company would go in the future. This has led to speculation that
            Studio Ghibli will never produce another feature film again. On
            November 7, 2014, Miyazaki stated, "That was not my intention,
            though. All I did was announce that I would be retiring and not
            making any more features." Lead producer Yoshiaki Nishimura among
            several other staffers from Ghibli, such as director Hiromasa
            Yonebayashi, left to found Studio Ponoc in April 2015, working on
            the film Mary and the Witch's Flower. The 2016 animated fantasy film
            The Red Turtle, directed and co-written by Dutch-British animator
            Michaël Dudok de Wit in his feature film debut, was a co-production
            between Studio Ghibli and Wild Bunch. In February 2017, Toshio
            Suzuki announced that Hayao Miyazaki has come out of retirement to
            direct a new feature film with Studio Ghibli. On November 28, 2017,
            Koji Hoshino stepped down as President; he was replaced by Kiyofumi
            Nakajima (former Ghibli Museum director). Hoshino was then appointed
            as Chairman of Studio Ghibli.
