A project dedicated to the reputable studio Ghibli and their amazing films I have grown with and loved.
I hope you can enjoy going through this mock site.

The API used can be found here: "https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com"

This project is only a development build using the latest version of React and Auth-0 for some minor authentication.
More features and a deployment build to follow soon.

run "sh install.sh" on any bash terminal to get all the npm packages and their dependencies installed.

Instructions are to follow in that file.
So i bid thee "Go forth and prosper",

Happy viewing!!!
