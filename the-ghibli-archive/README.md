A project dedicated to the reputable studio Ghibli and their amazing films I have grown with and loved.
I hope you can enjoy going through this mock site.

The API used can be found here: "https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com"

This project is only a development build using the latest version of React and Auth-0 for some minor authentication.
More features and a deployment build to follow soon.

The React project is in the "the-ghibli-archive" folder.
You will find the design I made in Adobe XD inside the respective design folder.

run "sh install.sh" on any bash terminal and a node.js environment inside the project folder (the-ghibli-archive) to get all the npm packages and their dependencies installed.

Instructions are to follow in that file.
So i bid thee "Go forth and prosper",

Happy viewing!!!
